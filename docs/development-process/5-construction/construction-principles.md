# Construction Principles

## Managing complexity is Sineworks's Primary Technical Imperative.

> “Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.“ —Martin Fowler

### Write code for people first, computers second.

### Construction is tranforming the design into an executable program.

### Nothing less than **quality** code is acceptable.

- **Quality code results in faster development.**
- **Quality code will be especially encouraged early in the construction process.**
- **Quality code is self-documenting.**
- **Every line of code will be reviewed and formally inspected.**
- **Quality examples will be documented and provided.**
- **Elegance is a requirement.**
- **Defects will be recorded with inspections, and defect hotspots will be noted.**
- **Testing is merely one way to ensure code quality and does not replace other methods.**

### The construction process is highly iterative.

- **Iterations serve to remove defects and improve code quality.**
- **Iteration encourages responding to change over following a plan.**
- **The primary purpose of formal inspections is to iterate.**
- **Iterations may include changing the design.**

### Changes will be controlled through the change control procedure.

- **Estimate the cost of changes.**
- **Relook design if there are a high volume of changes.**

### Consistently re-estimate the construction schedule.

### Construction progress will be measured.


- **Progress is not qualifiable.**
- **Progress is measured by working code.**
