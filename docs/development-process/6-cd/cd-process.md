## Principles of Continous Delivery

- The product should always be in a state to release the latest build
- Delivery is a collaborative effort (DevOps culture)
- Automate of all possible parts of the delivery process, using a Deployment Pipeline

## Deployment Pipeline

> "A deployment pipeline is an automated manifestation of your process for getting software from version control into the hands of your users."
