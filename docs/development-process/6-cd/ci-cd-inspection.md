## Continuous Integration

- [ ] A minimally configured environment can run the system after the execution of a single command
- [ ] Code is easy to find for a given piece of work
- [ ] Mainline is a single, shared branch that acts the current state of the product
- [ ] The build is self-testing
- [ ] Push to mainline triggers a build
- [ ] Builds are relatively fast
- [ ] Tests occur in a clone of the production environment

## Continuous Delivery

- [ ] Product maintains releasable status
- [ ] Product uses Deployment Pipeline

## Deployment Pipeline

- [ ] Unit tests occur before merging to mainline
- [ ] Integration tests occur before staging
- [ ] Regression tests occur before deployement
- [ ] On test fail, deployement reverts to commit phase (doesn't break the build)
