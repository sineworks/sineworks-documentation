## Experiment Document

- [ ] Relevant previous experiments identified / considered.
- [ ] Experiment goal is relevant, useful, and achievable.
- [ ] Hypothesis presents the independent variables and expected results on dependent variables.
- [ ] Clear, unambigious success criteria identified.
- [ ] Method identified and covers the scope of the experiment.
- [ ] Results / observations record the actual results on dependent variables.
- [ ] Lessons learned demonstrate progress in the project.
- [ ] Next steps identified.

## Experiment Implementation

- [ ] Code performs function as established by experiment goal.
- [ ] Code shows fulfillment of success criteria.
- [ ] If necessary, README provides all information needed to easily repeat experiment on another machine.
- [ ] Requirements/dependencies listed.

## Experiment Code

- [ ] Code avoids additional functionality.
- [ ] Code adheres to the provided style guide.
- [ ] Code is abstracted properly.
- [ ] Is the code well-structured, consistent in style, and consistently formatted?
- [ ] Are there any uncalled or unneeded procedures or any unreachable code?
- [ ] Are there any blocks of repeated code that could be condensed into a single procedure?
- [ ] Are symbolics used rather than “magic number” constants or string constants?
- [ ] Are any modules excessively complex and should be restructured or split into multiple routines?
- [ ] Code is written to be self-documenting.
- [ ] Are all variables properly defined with meaningful, consistent, and clear names?
- [ ] Are all loops, branches, and logic constructs complete, correct, and properly nested?
- [ ] Are the most common cases tested first in IF- -ELSEIF chains?
- [ ] Are indexes or subscripts properly initialized, just prior to the loop?
- [ ] Can any statements that are enclosed within loops be placed outside the loops?
