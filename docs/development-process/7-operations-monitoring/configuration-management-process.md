# Configuration Management Process

---

**A configuration is a collection of configuration items that includes, at a minimum:**

- Requirements document
- Design document
- Production code
- Required packages / tools
- Other documents related to project configuration

## 1. Determine configuration version

**ProductName-Baseline.Intermediate.Revision**

    - **Baseline**

        - Milestones in software development life cycle

        - Serves as the foundation for future development

    - **Intermediate**

        - Changes that require immediate attention

        - Usually only serves a portion of users for a limited period

        - Serves as a pilot version until changes are incorporated into next baseline version

    - **Revision**

        - Minor changes and corrections

        - Often have no effect on functionality

Ex: GroceryList-2.1.3

## 2. Compile configuration items

## 3. Relase configuration

## 4. Use change control process to alter configuration
